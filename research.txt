Most Interesting section for cyber security company (in my opinion) might be "Market Section" and all of threads interfaces
As a employee user goes to this section to search for a job and therefore he might share personal information. Personal information may be used to social networking
Promise opportunity for position in exchange to some actions on behalf of malefactor.
In threads interface user often share links, buttons, files. File might be trojans or other binary code that contains exploits, buttons and links may redirect to fishing pages and e.t.c
Fraud detection and attack preservation can be performed in each interface, Caution heading texts, warnings emails that may contain methods how not to be a victim
